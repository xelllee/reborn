PS, since  we will also be sending you a take-home assignment in your interview confirmation email (a big part of our technical interview involves a code review session),
 I figured it couldn't hurt to give you a little more time to prep on that stuff. So,
 I have enclosed that info as a bit of a head start on this project =)

The first Interview session (75 minutes) with two senior engineers on our team will be called TTT in your email confirmation from Anabel.

Focus: For the first half of this interview, we will conduct a code review session with you using either the Python or Java implementation of Tic-tac-toe  that we have linked below.
 We do code reviews as part of our interview process because every change at TellApart goes through a code review before getting checked in to production.

For the code review, imagine someone sent you this code review and you and the writer would have to work together on this in production going ahead.
We would like to hear what feedback you would give them about the design and production readiness of the code. We're not providing a style guide here so feel free to ignore style unless it's jarring to you.
That being said, however, you should also feel free to share any opinions you have on the code , especially regarding its extensibility and reusability.

The files related to our code review interview session can be found in the following locations:

You may choose either implementation to discuss in the interview. And i f you're not particularly strong with either language,
please let us know ahead of time (and we'll let our engineers know that this isn't your preferred language).

Based on the challenges you will encounter during this portion of our interview, I'd suggest that you take at least one to two hours to
review the code and think about ways you'd redesign this program to scale it from something sitting on disk toward internet scale (and all the stuff that would entail as well: load balancing, sharding, etc.).
