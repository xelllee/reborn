/**
 *
 * Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

 Only one letter can be changed at a time
 Each intermediate word must exist in the word list
 For example,

 Given:
 beginWord = "hit"
 endWord = "cog"
 wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
 As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
 return its length 5.
