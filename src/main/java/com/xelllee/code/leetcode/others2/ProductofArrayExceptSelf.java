 * Given an array of n integers where n > 1, nums, r
 * eturn an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
 * <p/>
 * Solve it without division and in O(n).
 * <p/>
 * For example, given [1,2,3,4], return [24,12,8,6].
 * <p/>
 * Follow up:
 * Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (Note: The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
